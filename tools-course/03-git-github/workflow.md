# My Understanding of Git Workflow

This is how I currently understand Git workflow:

1. Make changes to files.
2. Check status using git status.
3. Stage changes using git add.
4. Commit changes with a meaningful message.
5. Push to GitHub.

For features:
- Create a new branch.
- Work inside that branch.
- Commit changes.
- Push the branch.
- Merge back into main.

Key idea:
Commit small changes frequently instead of big commits.
